<h2 style="margin: 60px 0px 10px;">Short Bio</h2>

Daniel Rodriguez-Cardenas is  a Ph.D. candidate in Computer Science at [William & Mary](https://www.wm.edu/) ðŸ‡ºðŸ‡¸, advised by [Prof. Denys Poshyvanyk](https://www.cs.wm.edu/~denys/). My research focuses on <strong style="color: #13825d; font-weight:600">machine learning interpretability and software evolution</strong>, with an emphasis on applying causal inference, benchmarking and probing techniques to support software maintenance tasks such as vulnerability detection, code summarization, and generation. I have co-authored peer-reviewed publications in leading venues including ICSE and ICSME, and actively work with large language models and causal methods. My academic interests lie at the intersection of software engineering, AI, and artificial life, with a long-term goal of advancing the scientific foundations of intelligent software systems.
